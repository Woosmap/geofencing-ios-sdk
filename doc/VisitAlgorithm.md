## Algorithm Visit

Our SDK allows you to detect when and where a user has spent time, in another word when he visited some places. We consider a user is visiting a location when he spends time (multiple locations collected) at the same location (in a certain radius). Those visits are then used by our Zone of Interest algorithm to describe geographical patterns of your users.

Ths diagram explains the visit algorithm implemented in our SDK / code samples:
